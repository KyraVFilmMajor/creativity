<h1>How To Be Creative</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Give into what your mind is trying to convey to you/tell you.</li>
  <li>Let yourself find your creativity but don't try to force it.</li>
  <li>Be Audacious, own whatever you're creating and be confident in each decision you make with it.</li>
  <li>Let the ideas flow through you.</li>
  <li>Let yourself be imperfect, there's no such thing as perfect. It's a weird human concept. Being imperfect brings out more originality from you.</li>
  <li>Do not go back on any decisions you make and do not question yourself.</li>
  <li>Do not second guess each decision you have before you make it, it'll only cause you more stress.</li>
</ol>
